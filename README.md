# Filtering Forum Comments Using AI
Web App similar to Instagram which filters good and bad comments and actively deletes the bad ones.

## Features I'm trying to explore
Does Instagram have AI that assists with deleting malicious comments when a user turns off comments on their posts? Can I build something similar using java and JavaFX?

## Steps

### 1. Design Document (due: 25/09/2022)
**Useful resources**
<li> How to write a design document: https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/resources/design-document/

### 2. Basic Forum
The platform will not have any login/ register functionalities initially because that does not contribute to the larger goal of my question. Instead, users will be provided with a randomised username (which may change everytime?). The only functionalities availble will be: 
<li> Forum posting and commenting
<li> Toggle option to turn on/ off comments - anyone can do it initially because sign in/ register options do not exist

### 3. Testing

### 4. Develop AI that filters 'good' and 'bad' comments
This happens when the user turns off commenting on a forum post.
Considerations:
<li> What AI algorithm to apply (greedy, max-min, alpha-beta pruning, something else?)
<li> How to implement AI?
<li> Where to get examples of 'bad' comments?
<li> How to feed this information to the system?
<li> How to work with the data gained from this reading other 'bad' comments?

### 5. Fluff
Proposed features:
<li> Register, log in functionalities
<li> Upload pictures to forums

## Things I do not want
<li> Elaborate forum features like profile, dashboard, etc. This is meant to be a short project exploring a very specific question, not an attempt to create a dummy profile.
